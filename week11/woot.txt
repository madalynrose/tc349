I decided to review woot.com's mobile site because I remember them having a relatively nice mobile experience. Right away there is a large picture of today's sale. This is important because it's kind of the whole point of their site. They offer two menus. The one on the left lists their sub-sites with categorized sales. The one on the right offers account access and site support links. Everything important is right up top, properly sized, and easily accessible. 

Below there are the extra sales for that category. While these are tiled on the full browser site, they appear in one well-portioned list on the mobile one. At the very bottom appear all of the links available in the two menus at the top. This is good for the user who wants to minimize number of clicks. All forms are well adapted to the mobile experience. The site looks clean and is intuitive for users of the full browser site.
