			<p>This past year she worked as a software developer intern for <a href="http://www.techsmith.com/">TechSmith</a> on the Camtasia Relay team. Here, she worked with C# and the ASP/.Net framework to further develop the product, adding features and eliminating bugs through the Agile process model. Also, this internship has given her opportunities to work on mobile applications for the Windows Phone 7, iOS devices, and Android devices. She has worked part-time as a web programmer at <a href="http://www.matrix.msu.edu/">MATRIX</a> through Michigan State University, designing and implementing web pages focusing on managing, displaying, and analyzing large amounts of data using PHP, MySQL, and jQuery. She is an active member of the Michigan State University group, <a href="http://www.cse.msu.edu/msuwic/">Women in Computing</a>. This group has helped her to develop networking skills, and has allowed her to expose younger students to the field of computer science. </p>
