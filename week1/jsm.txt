	This website is very clean and concise. It gets to the point. The dominant colors are black, white, red, and gray—nice and simple. The chosen font is neither boring nor distracting; it is simple yet interesting. The home page displays what appear to be blog posts, arranged by date. Each article listing consists of three columns: the date, the title and maybe a blurb, and an image or video (or the blurb if there is no image or video to display). This looks clean and pleasing to the eye, yet proves to be rather monotonous. Perhaps it would be more appealing if every-other article listing employed a layout that mirrored the first, that is arranged in the reverse order.       The layout of the “reading” page is aesthetically pleasing, but there does not seem to be an order to the books listed. This makes it difficult for the user if they are looking for something in particular. The “about” page is laid out quite nicely, with a picture of prominent size, text about the person, and contact links. However, there are a lot of words on that page and it does appear to be a bit busy.      Each page includes a header and footer. These are both styled wonderfully. They display necessary information but are not cluttered, and employ space and images well.
