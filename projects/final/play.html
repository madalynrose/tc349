			<h2>Rabbits</h2>
			<p>I have two rabbits, and caring for them has been an incredibly fun adventure for me. They are much more complex characters than most people expect, and are relatively low maintenance. I love Toby and Bella dearly and will continue to learn more about them in the coming years.</p>

			<h2>Cooperative Living</h2>
			<p>This is my third year living in the Michigan State University Student Housing Coops. I think this is the perfect living situation for most people and recommend it to anyone who doesn't want to live in the dorms but still wants a full college experience.</p>
