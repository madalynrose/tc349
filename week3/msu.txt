	As far as university websites go, MSU's Homepage is pretty standard. It isn't too bogged down with text, 
	shows a decent amount of color, and is pretty dynamic instead of flat. The changing picture near the top of the page
	gives the page dimension and helps add variety to the page. 
	
	The menu across the top isn't too cluttered, and presents the information most likely to be seeked by the site's 
	visitors. If the desired information is outside the realm of the menu options, a helpful search option is available.
	
	The page appears more boring and flat near the bottom. Where the top is varied and interesting, the bottom of the
	page is bland and static.
