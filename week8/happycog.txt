This site appears to be laid out well and relatively simple. However, I greatly dislike the salmon/sage color scheme. Also, I don't like the layout at all. I had already scrolled through the voluminous amount of content before realizing that's what the links were for. There's just the one page with ajax calls to navigate to the different divs. I would prefer for the pages to be entirely separate because this makes the index page look cluttered. Also, it makes navigating through the site more difficult.

I do like the way the menu bar looks, and the font used on this site. The blog page looks really clean and I appreciate the styling of the drop-down menus.  I don't like that images are kept the same flat purple as the rest of the page though, this takes away from the presentation. I also like the inclusion of maps on th main page in the "contact" section. This adds dimension to the web page and puts the locations in context.
