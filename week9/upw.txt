This is the first website we've looked at in this class that I've navigated to and flat out hated. There's too much to look at all at once. Too many colors, too many words, just too much. The font is difficult to read since the letters all kind of blend together unless the words are really large. The only thing that stands out as something I appreciate is the footer. Everything is simple and well-laid-out. I like the animation on the images of the shirts, where the box jumps a little if you hover over it, but I wish the text and transparent overlay weren't there all the time since they take away from the already-small image.The helpful blurb texts pointing at various pictures completely get overlooked, even the larger ones about the blog and hiring. Because this page is so busy, nothing looks special and everything gets lost. 

The Roll Call instagram page looks better than the others, since it has fewer colors and doesn't cloud the picture with extra text. The podcast page is similarly simple and also wins my appreciation for that. Actually, all of the other pages win my approval except for the pixelivery page which displays many of the problems present in the home page here.
