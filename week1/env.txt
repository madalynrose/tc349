      The development environment I selected to use for homework 1, and will likely continue to utilize throughout this course, consists of TextWrangler, Chrome, and Terminal on a MacBook Pro with OSX version 10.7 (Lion). I have selected these as I have used them for previous web development projects and am fairly familiar with them.	TextWrangler is a free text editor with a directory view and editing space. This makes it very easy to edit multiple files at once. Also, TextWrangler employs colors to make code more readable. This is a priority for me when choosing a good editor. Chrome is my favorite browser and I choose to do most web development with it in mind. I also like Firefox, and avoid IE at all costs. Finally, Terminal is simple and bare-bones and also what comes with Mac, so that was an easy choice to make.
