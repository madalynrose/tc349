	Heroku's website looks sleek and concise. The origami graphics are simple but translate into a visual metaphor for the adaptability of this software. It is interesting to see a cloud application website without any cloud visuals present.
	I don't think I like the color scheme very much, though this is probably because I don't like monochrome things in general. The selections of different shades of purple and blue look good together, but I would appreciate more variety in the color palate of this page. 

	The visuals on the "How it Works" and "Pricing" pages are phenomenal. They add movement and life to the page. They also add meaning and give the user something more tangible than words to process. I don't like the "Add-ons" page at all because it looks like it doesn't even belong on this website. The color scheme and layout are too different from the main page to salvage any continuity. The "Dev Center" page is much more well done. While the color scheme is changed, the overall layout translates much better. I actually kind of wish this color scheme was used for the entire website.
